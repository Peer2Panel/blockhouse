We at Blockhouse are committed to protecting your privacy. For that reason, we try to avoid collecting any “Personal Data” from any of our users. “Personal Data” meaning any data that allows someone to identify you individually. The only information about you we, or anyone else, have access to, is your blockchain address. In addition, in order to be whitelisted we might need to verify your personal identity document. We only use it for the verification and for no other purposes.
