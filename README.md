### The Marketplace is live on Aurora: https://blockhouse.jonathanlehner.com/

https://devpost.com/software/blockhouse
- Buy, Sell and list NFTs representing fractional real estate ownership affordably and securely on the Blockchain.

- Exit your investment easily on our marketplace.
- Compound your rent revenues automatically.
- Borrow liquidity using your NFT as collateral.

*We do not position ourself as a competitor to RealT (https://realt.co/), but rather as a complementary project. We aim to be a dedicated marketplace where users can exchange and list their RealEstate tokens, and leverage the full benefits of Defi with their illiquid assets. We act as market makers by providing liquidity and bringing together real estate partners in different countries. (Switzerland, Singapore, Korea)*
